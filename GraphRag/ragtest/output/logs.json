Maria delle Grazie at Milan. It was originally\nexecuted in tempera on a badly prepared stucco ground and began to\ndeteriorate a very few years after its completion. As early as 1556 it\nwas half ruined. In 1652 the monks cut away a part of the fresco\nincluding the feet of the Christ to make a doorway. In 1726 one\nMichelangelo Belotti, an obscure Milanese painter, received £300 for\nthe worthless labour he bestowed on restoring it. He seems to have\nemployed some astringent restorative which revived the colours\ntemporarily, and then left them in deeper eclipse than before. In 1770\nthe fresco was again restored by Mazza. In 1796 Napoleon's cavalry,\ncontrary to his express orders, turned the refectory into a stable,\nand pelted the heads of the figures with dirt. Subsequently the\nrefectory was used to store hay, and at one time or another it has\nbeen flooded. In 1820 the fresco was again restored, and in 1854 this\nrestoration was effaced. In October 1908 Professor Cavenaghi completed\nthe delicate task of again restoring it, and has, in the opinion of\nexperts, now preserved it from further injury. In addition, the\ndevices of Ludovico and his Duchess and a considerable amount of\nfloral decoration by Leonardo himself have been brought to light.\n\nLeonardo has succeeded in producing the effect of the _coup de\nthéâtre_ at the moment when Jesus said \"One of you shall betray\nme.\" Instantly the various apostles realise that there is a traitor\namong their number, and show by their different gestures their\ndifferent passions, and reveal their different temperaments. On the\nleft of Christ is St. John who is overcome with grief and is\ninterrogated by the impetuous Peter, near whom is seated Judas\nIscariot who, while affecting the calm of innocence, is quite unable\nto conceal his inner feelings; he instinctively clasps the money-bag\nand in so doing upsets the salt-cellar.\n\nIt will be remembered that the Prior of the Convent complained to\nLudovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, that Leonardo was taking too long to\npaint the fresco and was causing the Convent considerable\ninconvenience. Leonardo had his revenge by threatening to paint the\nfeatures of the impatient Prior into the face of  Judas Iscariot. The\nincident has been quaintly told in the following lines:--\n\n  \"Padre Bandelli, then, complains of me\n  Because, forsooth, I have not drawn a line\n  Upon the Saviour's head; perhaps, then, he\n  Could without trouble paint that head divine.\n  But think, oh Signor Duca, what should be\n  The pure perfection of Our Saviour's face--\n  What sorrowing majesty, what noble grace,\n  At that dread moment when He brake the bread,\n  And those submissive words of pathos said:\n\n  \"'By one among you I shall be betrayed,'--\n  And say if 'tis an easy task to find\n  Even among the best that walk this Earth,\n  The fitting type of that divinest worth,\n  That has its image solely in the mind.\n  Vainly my pencil struggles to express\n  The sorrowing grandeur of such holiness.\n  In patient thought, in ever-seeking prayer,\n  I strive to shape that glorious face within,\n  But the soul's mirror, dulled and dimmed by sin,\n  Reflects not yet the perfect image there.\n  Can the hand do before the soul has wrought;\n  Is not our art the servant of our thought?\n\n  \"And Judas too, the basest face I see,\n  Will not contain his utter infamy;\n  Among the dregs and offal of mankind\n  Vainly I seek an utter wretch to find.\n  He who for thirty silver coins could sell\n  His Lord, must be the Devil's miracle.\n  Padre Bandelli thinks it easy is\n  To find the type of him who with a kiss\n  Betrayed his Lord. Well, what I can I'll do;\n  And if it please his reverence and you,\n  For Judas' face I'm willing to paint his.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  \"... I dare not paint\n  Till all is ordered and matured within,\n  Hand-work and head-work have an earthly taint,\n  But when the soul commands I shall begin;\n  On themes like these I should not dare to dwell\n  With our good Prior--they to him would be\n  Mere nonsense; he must touch and taste and see,\n  And facts, he says, are never mystical.\"\n\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.--THE HEAD OF CHRIST\n\nIn the Brera Gallery, Milan.
