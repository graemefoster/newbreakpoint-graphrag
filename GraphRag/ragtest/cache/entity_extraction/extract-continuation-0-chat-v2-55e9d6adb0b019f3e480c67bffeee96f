They prove that he was\nleft-handed and wrote from right to left.\n\n\n\n\nHIS MIND\n\nWe can readily believe the statements of Benvenuto Cellini, the\nsixteenth-century Goldsmith, that Francis I. \"did not believe\nthat any other man had come into the world who had attained so great a\nknowledge as Leonardo, and that not only as sculptor, painter, and\narchitect, for beyond that he was a profound philosopher.\" It was\nCellini also who contended that \"Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and\nRaphael are the Book of the World.\"\n\nLeonardo anticipated many eminent scientists and inventors in the\nmethods of investigation which they adopted to solve the many problems\nwith which their names are coupled. Among these may be cited\nCopernicus' theory of the earth's movement, Lamarck's classification\nof vertebrate and invertebrate animals, the laws of friction,\nthe laws of combustion and respiration, the elevation of the\ncontinents, the laws of gravitation, the undulatory theory of light\nand heat, steam as a motive power in navigation, flying machines, the\ninvention of the camera obscura, magnetic attraction, the use of the\nstone saw, the system of canalisation, breech loading cannon, the\nconstruction of fortifications, the circulation of the blood, the\nswimming belt, the wheelbarrow, the composition of explosives, the\ninvention of paddle wheels, the smoke stack, the mincing machine! It\nis, therefore, easy to see why he called \"Mechanics the Paradise\nof the Sciences.\"\n\nLeonardo was a SUPERMAN.\n\n\n\n\nHIS MAXIMS\n\n\n    The eye is the window of the soul.\n\n    Tears come from the heart and not from the brain.\n\n    The natural desire of good men is knowledge.\n\n    A beautiful body perishes, but a work of art dies not.\n\n    Every difficulty can be overcome by effort.\n\n    Time abides long enough for those who make use of it.\n\n    Miserable men, how often do you enslave yourselves\n    to gain money!\n\n\n\n\nHIS SPELL\n\nThe influence of Leonardo was strongly felt in Milan, where he spent\nso many of the best years of his life and founded a School of\npainting. He was a close observer of the gradation and reflex of\nlight, and was capable of giving to his discoveries a practical and\naesthetic form. His strong personal character and the fascination of\nhis genius enthralled his followers, who were satisfied to repeat his\ntypes, to perpetuate the \"grey-hound eye,\" and to make use of his\nlittle devices. Among this group of painters may be mentioned\nBoltraffio, who perhaps painted the \"Presumed Portrait of Lucrezia\nCrivelli\" (Plate VII.), which is officially attributed in the Louvre\nto the great master himself.\n\n\n\n\nHIS DESCENDANTS\n\n\nSignor Uzielli has shown that one Tommaso da Vinci, a descendant of\nDomenico (one of Leonardo's brothers), was a few years ago a peasant\nat Bottinacio near Montespertoli, and had then in his possession the\nfamily papers, which now form part of the archives of the Accademia\ndei Lincei at Rome. It was proved also that Tommaso had given his\neldest son \"the glorious name of Leonardo.\"\n######################\noutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
