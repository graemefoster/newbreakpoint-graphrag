The\nportrait was bought during the reign of Francis I. for a sum which is\nto-day equal to about £1800. Leonardo, by the way, does not seem to\nhave been really affected by any individual affection for any woman,\nand, like Michelangelo and Raphael, never married.\n\nIn January 4, 1504, Leonardo was one of the members of the Committee\nof Artists summoned to advise the Signoria as to the most suitable\nsite for the erection of Michelangelo's statue of \"David,\" which had\nrecently been completed.\n\n\n\n\nBATTLE OF ANGHIARI\n\nIn the following May he was commissioned by the Signoria to decorate\none of the walls of the Council Hall of the Palazzo Vecchio. The\nsubject he selected was the \"Battle of Anghiari.\" Although he\ncompleted the cartoon, the only part of the composition which he\neventually executed in colour was an incident in the foreground\nwhich dealt with the \"Battle of the Standard.\" One of the many\nsupposed copies of a study of this mural painting now hangs on the\nsouth-east staircase in the Victoria and Albert Museum. It depicts the\nFlorentines under Cardinal Ludovico Mezzarota Scarampo fighting\nagainst the Milanese under Niccolò Piccinino, the General of Filippo\nMaria Visconti, on June 29, 1440.\n\n\n\nAGAIN IN MILAN\n\nLeonardo was back in Milan in May 1506 in the service of the French\nKing, for whom he executed, apparently with the help of assistants,\n\"the Madonna, the Infant Christ, and Saint Anne\" (Plate VIII.). The\ncomposition of this oil-painting seems to have been built up on the\nsecond cartoon, which he had made some eight years earlier, and which\nwas apparently taken to France in 1516 and ultimately lost.\n\n\n\nIN ROME\n\nFrom 1513-1515 he was in Rome, where Giovanni de' Medici had been\nelected Pope under the title of Leo X. He did not, however, work for\nthe Pope, although he resided in the Vatican, his time being occupied\nin studying acoustics, anatomy, optics, geology, minerals,\nengineering, and geometry!\n\n\n\nIN FRANCE\n\nAt last in 1516, three years before his death, Leonardo left his\nnative land for France, where he received from Francis I. a princely\nincome. His powers, however, had already begun to fail, and he\nproduced very little in the country of his adoption. It is,\nnevertheless, only in the Louvre that his achievements as a painter\ncan to-day be adequately studied.\n\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.-MADONNA, INFANT CHRIST, AND ST. ANNE\n\nIn the Louvre.

He\nwas then seized with a paroxysm, the forerunner of death, when King\nFrancis I., who was accustomed frequently and affectionately to visit\nhim, rose and supported his head to give him such assistance and to do\nhim such favour as he could in the hope of alleviating his sufferings.\nThe spirit of Leonardo, which was most divine, conscious that he could\nattain to no greater honour, departed in the arms of the monarch,\nbeing at that time in the seventy-fifth year of his age.\" The not\nover-veracious chronicler, however, is here drawing largely upon his\nimagination. Leonardo was only sixty-seven years of age, and the King\nwas in all probability on that date at St. Germain-en Laye!\n\nThus died \"Mr. Lionard de Vincy, the noble Milanese, painter,\nengineer, and architect to the King, State Mechanician\" and \"former\nProfessor of Painting to the Duke of Milan.\"\n\n\"May God Almighty grant him His eternal peace,\" wrote his friend and\nassistant Francesco Melzi. \"Every one laments the loss of a man whose\nlike Nature cannot produce a second time.\"\n\n\n\nHIS ART\n\nLeonardo, whose birth antedates that of Michelangelo and Raphael by\ntwenty three and thirty-one years respectively, was thus in the\nforefront of the Florentine Renaissance, his life coinciding almost\n######################\noutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
