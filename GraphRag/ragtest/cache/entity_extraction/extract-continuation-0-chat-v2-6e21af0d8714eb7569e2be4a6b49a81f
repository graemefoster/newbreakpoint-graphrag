The drawing is dated December 29, 1479, the date of\nBandini's public execution in Florence.\n\nIn that year also, no doubt, was painted the early and, as might be\nexpected, unfinished \"St. Jerome in the Desert,\" now in the Vatican, the\nunder-painting being in umber and _terraverte_. Its authenticity is\nvouched for not only by the internal evidence of the picture itself, but\nalso by the similarity of treatment seen in a drawing in the Royal\nLibrary at Windsor. Cardinal Fesch, a princely collector in Rome in the\nearly part of the nineteenth century, found part of the picture--the\ntorso--being used as a box-cover in a shop in Rome. He long afterwards\ndiscovered in a shoemaker's shop a panel of the head which belonged to\nthe torso. The jointed panel was eventually purchased by Pope Pius IX.,\nand added to the Vatican Collection.\n\nIn March 1480 Leonardo was commissioned to paint an altar-piece for\nthe monks of St. Donato at Scopeto, for which payment in advance was\nmade to him. That he intended to carry out this contract seems most\nprobable. He, however, never completed the picture, although it gave\nrise to the supremely beautiful cartoon of the \"Adoration of the\nMagi,\" now in the Uffizi (No. 1252). As a matter of course it is\nunfinished, only the under-painting and the colouring of the figures\nin green on a brown ground having been executed. The rhythm of line,\nthe variety of attitude, the profound feeling for landscape and an\nearly application of chiaroscuro effect combine to render this one of\nhis most characteristic productions.\n\nVasari tells us that while Verrocchio was painting the \"Baptism of\nChrist\" he allowed Leonardo to paint in one of the attendant angels\nholding some vestments. This the pupil did so admirably that his\nremarkable genius clearly revealed itself, the angel which Leonardo\npainted being much better than the portion executed by his master.\nThis \"Baptism of Christ,\" which is now in the Accademia in Florence\nand is in a bad state of preservation, appears to have been a\ncomparatively early work by Verrocchio, and to have been painted\nin 1480-1482, when Leonardo would be about thirty years of age.\n\nTo about this period belongs the superb drawing of the \"Warrior,\" now\nin the Malcolm Collection in the British Museum. This drawing may have\nbeen made while Leonardo still frequented the studio of Andrea del\nVerrocchio, who in 1479 was commissioned to execute the equestrian\nstatue of Bartolommeo Colleoni, which was completed twenty years later\nand still adorns the Campo di San Giovanni e Paolo in Venice.\n\n\n\n\nFIRST VISIT TO MILAN\n\n\nAbout 1482 Leonardo entered the service of Ludovico Sforza, having\nfirst written to his future patron a full statement of his various\nabilities in the following terms:--\n\n\"Having, most illustrious lord, seen and pondered over the experiments\nmade by those who pass as masters in the art of inventing instruments\nof war, and having satisfied myself that they in no way differ from\nthose in general use, I make so bold as to solicit, without prejudice\nto any one, an opportunity of informing your excellency of some of my\nown secrets.\"\n\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.-THE LAST SUPPER\n\nRefectory of St. Maria delle Grazie, Milan. About 13 feet\n8 ins. h. by 26 ft. 7 ins. w. (4.16 x 8.09)]\n\nHe goes on to say that he can construct light bridges which can be\ntransported, that he can make pontoons and scaling ladders, that he\ncan construct cannon and mortars unlike those commonly used, as well\nas catapults and other engines of war; or if the fight should take\nplace at sea that he can build engines which shall be suitable alike\nfor defence as for attack, while in time of peace he can erect public\nand private buildings. Moreover, he urges that he can also execute\nsculpture in marble, bronze, or clay, and, with regard to painting,\n\"can do as well as any one else, no matter who he may be.\" In\nconclusion, he offers to execute the proposed bronze equestrian statue\nof Francesco Sforza \"which shall bring glory and never-ending honour\nto that illustrious house.\"\n\nIt was about 1482, the probable date of Leonardo's migration from\nFlorence to Milan, that he painted the \"Vierge aux Rochers,\" now in\nthe Louvre (No. 1599). It is an essentially Florentine picture, and\nalthough it has no pedigree earlier than 1625, when it was in the\nRoyal Collection at Fontainebleau, it is undoubtedly much earlier and\nconsiderably more authentic than the \"Virgin of the Rocks,\" now in the\nNational Gallery (Plate III.).\n\nHe certainly set to work about this time on the projected statue of\nFrancesco Sforza, but probably then made very little progress with it.\nHe may also in that year or the next have painted the lost portrait of\nCecilia Gallerani, one of the mistresses of Ludovico Sforza.
