  And say if 'tis an easy task to find
  Even among the best that walk this Earth,
  The fitting type of that divinest worth,
  That has its image solely in the mind.
  Vainly my pencil struggles to express
  The sorrowing grandeur of such holiness.
  In patient thought, in ever-seeking prayer,
  I strive to shape that glorious face within,
  But the soul's mirror, dulled and dimmed by sin,
  Reflects not yet the perfect image there.
  Can the hand do before the soul has wrought;
  Is not our art the servant of our thought?

  "And Judas too, the basest face I see,
  Will not contain his utter infamy;
  Among the dregs and offal of mankind
  Vainly I seek an utter wretch to find.
  He who for thirty silver coins could sell
  His Lord, must be the Devil's miracle.
  Padre Bandelli thinks it easy is
  To find the type of him who with a kiss
  Betrayed his Lord. Well, what I can I'll do;
  And if it please his reverence and you,
  For Judas' face I'm willing to paint his."

       *       *       *       *       *

  "... I dare not paint
  Till all is ordered and matured within,
  Hand-work and head-work have an earthly taint,
  But when the soul commands I shall begin;
  On themes like these I should not dare to dwell
