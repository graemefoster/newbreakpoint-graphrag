invention of the camera obscura, magnetic attraction, the use of the
stone saw, the system of canalisation, breech loading cannon, the
construction of fortifications, the circulation of the blood, the
swimming belt, the wheelbarrow, the composition of explosives, the
invention of paddle wheels, the smoke stack, the mincing machine! It
is, therefore, easy to see why he called "Mechanics the Paradise
of the Sciences."

Leonardo was a SUPERMAN.




HIS MAXIMS


    The eye is the window of the soul.

    Tears come from the heart and not from the brain.

    The natural desire of good men is knowledge.

    A beautiful body perishes, but a work of art dies not.

    Every difficulty can be overcome by effort.

    Time abides long enough for those who make use of it.

    Miserable men, how often do you enslave yourselves
    to gain money!




HIS SPELL

The influence of Leonardo was strongly felt in Milan, where he spent
so many of the best years of his life and founded a School of
painting. He was a close observer of the gradation and reflex of
light, and was capable of giving to his discoveries a practical and
aesthetic form. His strong personal character and the fascination of
his genius enthralled his followers, who were satisfied to repeat his
types, to perpetuate the "grey-hound eye," and to make use of his
little devices. Among this group of painters may be mentioned
Boltraffio, who perhaps painted the "Presumed Portrait of Lucrezia
Crivelli" (Plate VII.), which is officially attributed in the Louvre
to the great master himself.
