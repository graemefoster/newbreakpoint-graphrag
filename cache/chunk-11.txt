the delicate task of again restoring it, and has, in the opinion of
experts, now preserved it from further injury. In addition, the
devices of Ludovico and his Duchess and a considerable amount of
floral decoration by Leonardo himself have been brought to light.

Leonardo has succeeded in producing the effect of the _coup de
théâtre_ at the moment when Jesus said "One of you shall betray
me." Instantly the various apostles realise that there is a traitor
among their number, and show by their different gestures their
different passions, and reveal their different temperaments. On the
left of Christ is St. John who is overcome with grief and is
interrogated by the impetuous Peter, near whom is seated Judas
Iscariot who, while affecting the calm of innocence, is quite unable
to conceal his inner feelings; he instinctively clasps the money-bag
and in so doing upsets the salt-cellar.

It will be remembered that the Prior of the Convent complained to
Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, that Leonardo was taking too long to
paint the fresco and was causing the Convent considerable
inconvenience. Leonardo had his revenge by threatening to paint the
features of the impatient Prior into the face of  Judas Iscariot. The
incident has been quaintly told in the following lines:--

  "Padre Bandelli, then, complains of me
  Because, forsooth, I have not drawn a line
  Upon the Saviour's head; perhaps, then, he
  Could without trouble paint that head divine.
  But think, oh Signor Duca, what should be
  The pure perfection of Our Saviour's face--
  What sorrowing majesty, what noble grace,
  At that dread moment when He brake the bread,
  And those submissive words of pathos said:

  "'By one among you I shall be betrayed,'--
