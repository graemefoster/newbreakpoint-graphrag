The Louvre is the location of several significant artworks, including a portrait, 'Vierge aux Rochers,' 'Annunciation,' and a notable copy of 'The Last Supper.' The portrait of Isabella d'Este is also housed there. The Louvre authorities are relevant to a painting's attribution, and it is where the achievements of a painter can be adequately studied today.
