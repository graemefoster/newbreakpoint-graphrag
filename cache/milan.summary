Milan is central to the events described, including Leonardo da Vinci's influence and work. Leonardo migrated from Florence to Milan around 1482 to work for Ludovico Sforza and was resident there by 1487. His notable works, such as 'The Virgin of the Rocks' and the conception of the head of Christ, were created in Milan, where the Chapel of the Conception is also situated. The Brera Gallery in Milan houses some of his works. Leonardo returned to Milan in May 1506, and his legacy is deeply tied to the city, often referred to as 'the noble Milanese'.
